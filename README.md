# DriveDecision

**DriveDecision** is a decision engine created by Quirk AI that helps consumers determine whether buying or leasing a vehicle is the financially safer option based on their personal situation.

Unlike generic calculators, DriveDecision focuses on **risk, cash-flow stress, and long-term impact**, not just monthly payments.

## 🚗 What Problem This Solves

Car buying decisions are emotionally charged, expensive, and easy to get wrong.

Most tools:
- Show numbers without context
- Focus only on monthly payment
- Avoid making a clear recommendation

DriveDecision by Quirk AI provides a **clear verdict** with an explanation that answers:

> *“Given my situation, should I buy or lease this car?”*

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user enters:
   - Basic financial profile
   - Buy scenario details
   - Lease scenario details

2. A deterministic decision engine calculates:
   - Total cost of use
   - Monthly obligation stress
   - Downside risk if income drops
   - Exit flexibility

3. An explanation layer translates the results into:
   - Plain-language reasoning
   - Risk flags
   - A confidence score

Quirk AI **does not invent numbers or predict markets**.  
It explains verified calculations.
